Telemeter Python wrapper
-------------------------

This project is a collection of python classes that wrap the public SOAP API 
for the Telemeter service of the Belgian Telenet ISP.

I am writing this wrapper because I intend on writing a few utility applications
using this API. Currently I have plans for:

- a commandline tool
- a gnome panel widget
- a Boxee app

If you would like to use this wrapper for other applications feel free to do so.
If you do, I would appreciate it if you keep me up to date about your project by
sending me an email at steven.v.bael@gmail.com. 

How to use the api
------------------

- Include the TelemeterService.py file in your project and import TelemeterService
where you need it.
- Create a new instance of the TelemeterService class:
    service = TelemeterService("username", "password")
- Fetch the data:
    response = service.fetchData()
- The returned response will be an instance of the TelemeterUsageData class

How to use TelemeterCli.py
--------------------------
TelemeterCli is a commandline tool that fetches your telemeter data and displays
it on screen. 

- Make sure both TelemeterCli.py and TelemeterService.py are in the same directory
- Edit TelemeterCli.py and change the username and password fields in one of the
first lines.
- Run "python TelemeterCli.py" 

TODO
----

- Add exception handling for both TelemeterService.py and TelemeterCli.py
- Add commandline arguments to TelemeterCli so the output is configurable
    (data unit, what values to display)
