Telemeter Python wrapper
-------------------------

This project is a collection of python classes that wrap the public SOAP API 
for the Telemeter service of the Belgian Telenet ISP.

I am writing this wrapper because I intend on writing a few utility applications
using this API. Currently I have plans for:

- a commandline tool
- a gnome panel widget
- a Boxee app

If you would like to use this wrapper for other applications feel free to do so.
If you do, I would appreciate it if you keep me up to date about your project by
sending me an email at steven.v.bael@gmail.com.
